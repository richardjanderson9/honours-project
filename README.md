# Honours-Project

This repository stores all the needed components for my honours project. It has been programmed using VSCode and utilises web technologies such as Bootstrap and JQuery. 

The Web-Application can be viewed using the links below. The service has been deployed as part of an App-Service that uses Microsoft Azure. The service operates on a SAAS (Software-As-A-Service) based modal. The only requirement is to upload the code to GitHub, and Microsoft does the rest (as my accounts are connected (via API)).
